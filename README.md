# Mini Jeopardy Code Challenge

## Installation

You don't need to install the app, but you do need to have python 3 and pip installed, and you need to install the required libraries:

~~~sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Running the Script

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the script with python:

~~~sh
python app.py
~~~

It does not support any command lines arguments or options or any configuration, so any changes currently require modifying the code directly.

## Running tests

You can run the unit tests by running the following:

~~~sh
python -m unittest -v lib/tests/test_jservice.py
~~~
